`#elixir`, `#otp`

I have described all the major patterns for working with processes in `elixir`.

The target audience was rather strong in the topic,
so it was full of code examples and in-depth topics.

### Elixir: is it good? When to use?

`#elixir`, `#ruby`

A lot of `ruby` developers seem to be interested in `elixir`.

So, I have described when to use `elixir`, and when to use it.

`#elixir`, `#ruby`

When speaking about `elixir` among `ruby` developers you have to understand
the main idea: these languages are not the same.

Even if the syntax looks familiar. They are completely different.
And I have shown that `elixir` solves a lot of the problems we have in `ruby`.
